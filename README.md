Hi, this is a test in which i have to make a moudoul with two simple functions (named simp.py)
two complex functions (named comp.py)
and a zip of two lists (named col.py)
all inside the tools file under numbers file

in app.py theres a menu to test and use those functions
in which col.py's function is called when app.py is called and also a menu pops up
in the menu the user can choose which function he wants to check out BUT have to check one of the simple functions
before trying the complex functions.
